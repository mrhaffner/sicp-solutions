These are my solutions to selected problems from the book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (2nd edition) a.k.a. SICP.

My solutions are written in Clojure. The book uses Scheme. These languages are both LISPs - so there is not much of a difference.

The solutions are not meant to be run directly from the solution file. Instead copy and paste them into your REPL.
